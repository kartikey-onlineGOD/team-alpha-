Staying Safe After a Tsunami

If you do nothing else:

Let friends and family know you’re safe.<br>

If evacuated, return only when authorities say it is safe to do so.<br>

Continue listening to local news or a NOAA Weather Radio for updated information and instructions.<br>

If people around you are injured, practice CHECK, CALL, CARE. Check the scene to be sure it’s safe for you to approach, call for help, and if you are trained, provide first aid to those in need until emergency responders can arrive.<br>
