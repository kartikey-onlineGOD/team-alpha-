<br><i>Practice drop, cover and hold on with all members of your household.</i></br>
<br>Doorways are no stronger than any other part of a structure so don’t rely on them for protection! During an earthquake, get under a sturdy piece of furniture and hold on.</br>
Staying Safe Indoors<br>

DROP, COVER and HOLD ON!<br>
Move as little as possible - most injuries during earthquakes occur because of people moving around, falling and suffering sprains, fractures and head injuries.<br>
Try to protect your head and torso.<br>
If you are in bed, stay there, curl up and hold on, and cover your head.<br>
Stay indoors until the shaking stops and you are sure it is safe to exit.<br>
If you must leave a building after the shaking stops, use stairs rather than an elevator in case of aftershocks, power outages or other damage.<br>
Be aware that smoke alarms and sprinkler systems frequently go off in buildings during an earthquake, even if there is no fire.<br>
If you smell gas, get out of the house and move as far away as possible.<br>
Before you leave any building check to make sure that there is no debris from the building that could fall on you.<br>
 

<br>Staying Safe Outdoors</br>

Find a clear spot and drop to the ground. Stay there until the shaking stops.<br>
Try to get as far away from buildings, power lines, trees, and streetlights as possible.<br>
If you're in a vehicle, pull over to a clear location and stop. Avoid bridges, overpasses and power lines if possible.<br>
Stay inside with your seatbelt fastened until the shaking stops.<br>
After the shaking has stopped, drive on carefully, avoiding bridges and ramps that may have been damaged.<br>
If a power line falls on your vehicle, do not get out. Wait for assistance.<br>
If you are in a mountainous area or near unstable slopes or cliffs, be alert for falling rocks and other debris as well as landslides.<br>
